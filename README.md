# Disease Prediction using NLP

Disease prediction based on symptoms provided in a single text input using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The `disease_prediction.ipynb` notebook contains the testing code used to build the models.

## Installation & Running

1. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install streamlit numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk matplotlib
```

2. Compile and save the models by running the entire `disease_prediction.ipynb` file.

3. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Make sure to replace `app.py` with the filename of your Streamlit application file if it's different.
